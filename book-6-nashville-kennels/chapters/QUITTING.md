# Removing Employees

Sadly, sometimes employees quit and you need to replace them. You've already implemented the feature to hire a new employee, but now you need to implement a `removeEmployee()` function in your **`EmployeeProvider`** component.

Add a button to your individual employee representations that, when clicked, invokes the `removeEmployee()` function and then immediately renders the **`EmployeeList`** component so that you can see that the employee has been removed from the database.
