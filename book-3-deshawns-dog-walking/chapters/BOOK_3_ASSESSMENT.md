# Events and Debugging Assessment

Time to assess how well you have learned to use the debugging tools in Chrome Dev Tools, and writing click event listeners.

This application is to show kids with illnesses and the memories the would like to make. Celebrities sign up to help kids make memories.

## Event Listeners to Create

1. When the kid name is clicked, it should display their wish.
1. When the celebrity name is clicked, it should display their sport.

Below is an animation showing how the application should look when complete and how the event listeners should work.

## Setup

Run the following command in your terminal.

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nashville-software-school/client-side-mastery/srb-split-glassdale/book-3-deshawns-dog-walking/chapters/scripts/assessment.sh)"
```

The script will place some boilerplate code in the following directory.

```sh
workspace/assessments/debugging-events
```

Then open that directory in VS Code and start fixing bugs. You will need to either write some new code, or make changes to existing code to make it all work.
