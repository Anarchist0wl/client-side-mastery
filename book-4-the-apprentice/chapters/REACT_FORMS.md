# Adding Animals with Forms in React

In this chapter, you are going to learn how to use use a form to express the state of a component, and then use a function passed from a parent component to add the animal to the API.

**_Quick Note_:** All of the code you will see from here to the end of this chapter needs to be in place before the feature will work.

## Route for Showing Animal Form

Below is a new route that renders a form for boarding a new animal. The `employees` collection needs to be passed to the form component so that a dropdown list can be populated for the user to choose a caretaker. You also need to update the route for `/animals` so that the `props` argument is passed down to the child component. This sets up the ability to use the very helpful `history.push()` mechanism in the components themselves to change the URL in the browser.

First, update your route with this code.

```jsx
<Route exact path="/animals" render={(props) => {
    return <AnimalList {...props}
                       deleteAnimal={this.deleteAnimal}
                       animals={this.state.animals} />
}} />

// Our shiny new route. We pass employees to the AnimalForm so a dropdown can be populated
<Route path="/animals/new" render={(props) => {
    return <AnimalForm {...props}
                       addAnimal={this.addAnimal}
                       employees={this.state.employees} />
}} />
```

## Button for Admitting a New Animal

Now, update **`AnimalList`** with a button at the top that uses the `history.push()` mechanism to change the URL of the browser. This will only work if you updated your routes correctly from the previous section, because you will need access to the `history` property that exists on the `props` object.

So, what's going on here? Think of the current location as the last item in an array of locations, and we manipulate that array through the `history.push()` method. Most importantly, pushing a location to the array triggers a page transition to that location.

```js
export default class AnimalList extends Component {
    render () {
        return (
            <React.Fragment>
                <div className="animalButton">
                    <button type="button"
                            className="btn btn-success"
                            onClick={() => {
                                this.props.history.push("/animals/new")}
                            }>
                        Admit Animal
                    </button>
                </div>
                <section className="animals">
                {
        ...
```

Update `Animal.css` to center the button.

> Animal.css

```css
.animalButton {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-evenly;
  margin: 0 0 10px 0;
}
```

## AnimalManager Method for POSTing Animal

Refactor your **`AnimalManager`** module with a `post` method that implements a `fetch()` for adding a new animal object to your API.

```js
post(newAnimal) {
    return fetch(`${remoteURL}/animals`, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(newAnimal)
    }).then(data => data.json())
  }
```

## ApplicationViews Method

Since you can't pass the `post()` method from the manager module to a component, you must write a method in **`ApplicationViews`** that implements it. You can then pass this method down to the **`AnimalForm`** component.

```js
addAnimal = animal =>
  AnimalManager.post(animal)
    .then(() => AnimalManager.getAll())
    .then(animals =>
      this.setState({
        animals: animals
      })
    );
```

## AnimalForm Component

Now it's time to make your **`AnimalForm`** component. Note that the `handleFieldChange()` method will update state every time the user types a character into any field. This is made possible by having each input field's `id` property named exactly as each state property.

It's vital to note that what this creates is a process that allows us to create new data ( the new animal ) based on the current state of the component. We are not pulling data directly from the form imputs and saving that to the database. The React way is to make sure that all data changes flow through state like this, so the UI and state stay in sync.

In state, you see three properties:

1. `animalName`
1. `breed`
1. `employeeId`

There are three, directly corresponding input fields:

1. `<input id="animalName" ... />`
1. `<input id="breed" ... />`
1. `<select id="employeeId" ...>`

> components/animal/AnimalForm.js

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import "./Animal.css";

export default class AnimalForm extends Component {
  // Set initial state
  state = {
    animalName: "",
    breed: "",
    employeeId: ""
  };

  // Update state whenever an input field is edited
  handleFieldChange = evt => {
    const stateToChange = {};
    stateToChange[evt.target.id] = evt.target.value;
    this.setState(stateToChange);
  };

  /*
        Local method for validation, creating animal object, and
        invoking the function reference passed from parent component
     */
  constructNewAnimal = evt => {
    evt.preventDefault();
    if (this.state.employee === "") {
      window.alert("Please select a caretaker");
    } else {
      const animal = {
        name: this.state.animalName,
        breed: this.state.breed,
        // Make sure the employeeId is saved to the database as a number since it is a foreign key.
        employeeId: parseInt(this.state.employeeId)
      };

      // Create the animal and redirect user to animal list
      this.props
        .addAnimal(animal)
        .then(() => this.props.history.push("/animals"));
    }
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <React.Fragment>
        <form className="animalForm">
          <div className="form-group">
            <label htmlFor="animalName">Animal name</label>
            <input
              type="text"
              required
              className="form-control"
              onChange={this.handleFieldChange}
              id="animalName"
              placeholder="Animal name"
            />
          </div>
          <div className="form-group">
            <label htmlFor="breed">Breed</label>
            <input
              type="text"
              required
              className="form-control"
              onChange={this.handleFieldChange}
              id="breed"
              placeholder="Breed"
            />
          </div>
          <div className="form-group">
            <label htmlFor="employee">Assign to caretaker</label>
            <select
              defaultValue=""
              name="employee"
              id="employeeId"
              onChange={this.handleFieldChange}
            >
              <option value="">Select an employee</option>
              {this.props.employees.map(e => (
                <option key={e.id} id={e.id} value={e.id}>
                  {e.name}
                </option>
              ))}
            </select>
          </div>
          <button
            type="submit"
            onClick={this.constructNewAnimal}
            className="btn btn-primary"
          >
            Submit
          </button>
        </form>
      </React.Fragment>
    );
  }
}
```

## Using the Form

Once you've got all these pieces in place, click on the _Admit Animal_ button, fill out the form, and submit it. You should immediately see your new animal in the list.

## Practice: Kennels: Adding Employees and Owners

1. Create forms for employees and owners.
1. Update **`EmployeeManager`** and **`OwnerManager`** with methods to POST new objects to the API.
1. Create methods in **`ApplicationViews`** to invoke the manager methods, and pass those functions to the appropriate child components.

## Practice: Kandy Korner: Adding Employees

1. Create a form for adding an employee.
1. Update **`EmployeeManager`** with methods to POST new objects to the API.
1. Create a method in **`ApplicationViews`** to invoke the manager methods, and pass those functions to the appropriate child components.

## Practice: Kandy Korner: Adding Candies

1. Create a form for adding a new candy. This form will need to display a drop-down for showing candy types, so you will need to send that state variable from **`KandyKorner`** to **`CandyForm`**
1. Update **`CandyManager`** with methods to POST new objects to the API.
1. Create a method in **`ApplicationViews`** to invoke the manager methods, and pass those functions to the child component.

Sample code for adding candy types drop down.

```js
<select
  defaultValue=""
  name="candyType"
  id="candyTypeId"
  onChange={this.handleFieldChange}
>
  <option value="">Select an candy type</option>
  {this.props.candyTypes.map(ct => (
    <option key={ct.id} id={ct.id} value={ct.id}>
      {ct.name}
    </option>
  ))}
</select>
```
