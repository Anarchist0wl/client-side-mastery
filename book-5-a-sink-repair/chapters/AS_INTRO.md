# A Sink Repair Service

Maude &amp; Merle Baumgardner were married in 1994 after a brief courtship. They are both licensed plumbers and met while working a job together on a major office building.

Spark flew.

Now they have decided to start a family business and started a sink repair and plumbing service.

They have hired you to create a web application that will let people submit service requests that they can view quickly what needs to be done. They want people to register an account with their full name and email address. A person can come back at any time and enter their name and email on a login page to use the application.

They want a person to enter in a description of the job, the address where the work needs to be done, their spending limit for the job, and a date the work should be completed by.

Once they are done with a job, they want that service request to be marked as complete. They also want to track who worked on the service request _(Maude or Merle)_.

If they don't have time to work on a particular request, they want the ability to delete it from the list.

## ERD

Just from that general description of their needs, take a shot at creating an ERD that will store all of the information needed for this application.

Once you feel you have a good ERD, review it with an instructor.

## Setup

Run the following command to get your basic directory structure set up. It will create a project directory for you at `~/workspace/sink-repair`.

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nashville-software-school/client-side-mastery/cohort-48/book-5-a-sink-repair/chapters/scripts/sink-repair-setup.sh)"
