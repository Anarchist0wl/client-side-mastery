## Deep Learning

Another reminder from the instruction team. This is NOT A TEST. We are not looking for 100% completion, although if you can make it work completely, then huzzah for you.

What we are looking for is effort, critical thinking about the concepts, creative thinking to bind the concepts together for a solution, and collaboration with your teammates and instruction team.

If you only get 50% of it complete, but display the above Core Skills and can demonstrate understanding of the fundamental code concepts, then you are learning and growing - which is what we care about.
