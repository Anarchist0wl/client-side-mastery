# List of Employees

In this chapter, you will see how to build a new view so that any employee can see a list of all employees. You will also practice a bit more with props. Lastly, you will use route parameters to view further details for an individual employee.

Watch the [Employee List](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/7erLnxgQhGELatVfVvhY) video and then implement the code yourself.
