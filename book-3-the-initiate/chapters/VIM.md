# Vim

Vim is a text editor like the one you are using now, but it is completely unlike it, in that everything is driven by the keyboard. You cannot use the mouse when working in vim. It simply serves no purpose and can actually break vim if you try to use it.

My favorite way for students to learn vim is the online, interactive tutorial on [openvim](http://www.openvim.com/tutorial.html). Head on over and learn the basics of the terminal-based text editor.
