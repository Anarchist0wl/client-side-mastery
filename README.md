# Welcome to Nashville Software School

Welcome to an experiment in education. Learning software development isn't like learning anything else, so we're not going to treat it like anything else. This is likely going to be a very different experience from your high school chemistry class or your college intro to philosophy.

You must be curious.

You must ask questions.

You must be ok with a serious amount of failing before succeeding.

You must be ok with being uncomfortable.

## Instructor Responsibilities

1. The instructor will present all of the critical material necessary to build a capstone by the end of the course.
1. The instructor will make sure all student questions are answered. Even the ones you consider to be "dumb", because "dumb" questions are often the most enlightening.

## Student Responsibilities

1. Owning your experience, which includes:
    * Show up to class
    * Participate in class discussions and group projects
    * Complete the exercises for each  milestone, the individual challenge for each milestone, and top it all off with a capstone project
    * Timing is flexible, if  you need a little more time to completely understand a topic, take some time, ask for help and fill in any gaps in your understanding.
1. Ask questions! Even if the question is a "huh, I don't know where to start," it is absolutely imperative that students take responsibility for their own understanding and clarify any questions right away.
1. Make sure you are putting in the time and effort to reach success.
1. Work through the exercises for each milestone before you attempt the challenge. Skipping ahead to the challenge is the best way to cheat yourself out of understanding.

> **Bottom Line:** We will give you all of the ingredients, but it's up to you to bake the cake.

### Why

First, and most importantly, in software development, each concept builds upon the previous concept, so general understanding of each concept is necessary before moving on. Second, teaching adults over the course of 6 months is a unique situation, and the adults we accept into the program are expected to have the work ethic needed to forge their own path.
