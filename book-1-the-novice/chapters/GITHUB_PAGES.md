# Publishing with Github Pages

Github provides a simple mechanism to publish a static web site. By static web site, it must meet the following critieria.

1. Your site must not use XHR or `$ajax()` to load any of your site files.
1. Your site must be dependant upon a persistent database file, or system.
1. Your site must not rely upon any automation tools like Grunt, Gulp, Sass, or Webpack to operate.

The [Github documentation for publishing](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/) is easy to follow, so we won't regurgutate the information here.
