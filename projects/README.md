# Course Projects

After you complete the work in the Core Books of the course, you instructors will provide guidance on which of these projects that you can choose to work on. There are four tiers of projects.

## Tier 1 - Beginner

Tier 1 projects are for students to start working on in the first couple weeks of the course. These projects may start simple to reinforce the basics of what has been covered, but will also scale with you as you progress in skills.

1. [Daily Journal](./tier-1-daily-journal/) - This project will scale with your skills. You begin with basic wireframes and data design, and by the end of the project, you will have built a highly complex, modular web application.
2. [Modern Farm](./tier-1-modern-farm/)

## Tier 2 - Advanced Beginner

Tier 2 projects are for students who have the basic vocabulary and skills in JavaScript and web development, and want to explore the concepts at a deeper level.
