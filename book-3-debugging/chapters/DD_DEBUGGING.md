# Fixing DeShawn's Application

DeShawn hired some consulting agency from overseas to build a simple application that displayed the following information.

1. A list of cities where his service is provided.
1. A list of dog walkers that are currently working for him.
1. A list of pets that are currently being given walks by his employees.
1. A full list of current assignments.

Unfortunately, the overseas developer had an unfortunate noodle-related accident, and the only version that DeShawn has is filled with bugs. Your job is to fix the bugs.

Here's what the output of the application should look like.

## Bugs to Fix

This table shows you how many bugs there are in each module.

| Main | CityList | Walkers | Assignments | CSS |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 |

Refer to the videos in the previous chapter to use your Chrome Dev Tools, and the debugger to find and fix the issues.

Do not use any `console.log()` statements.
