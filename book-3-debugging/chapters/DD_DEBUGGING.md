# Fixing DeShawn's Application

DeShawn hired some consulting agency from overseas to build a simple application that displayed the following information.

1. A list of cities where his service is provided.
1. A list of dog walkers that are currently working for him.
1. A list of pets that are currently being given walks by his employees.

Here's what the output of the application should look like.
