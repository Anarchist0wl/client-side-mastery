# Displaying Employee and Animals per Facility

At this point, you should have a **`FacilityDetails`** component that displays the details of a facility. Time to refactor it.

* Display a comma-separated list of employees that work at the facility.
* Display a comma-separated list of animals that are currently being cared for at the facility.

> **Tip:** Make sure you wrap the `<FacilityDetail>` component in `<EmployeeProvider>` and `<AnimalProvider>` in the **`ApplicationViews`** component.
