# Custom Events Workshop

Your instructional team will set up a Foundation Workshop day where you can practice designing and building a couple small applications that accept user input, modify API state, syncronize application state, and re-render a list of items. The team will pick the topics, but it will be along the lines of the following themes.

* Adding an ingredient to a pantry API and a list of available ingredients immediately updating.
* Adding an player to a sports API and a list of active player immediately updating.
* Adding an dog to a dog park API and a list of dogs immediately updating.

By the end of the workshop, you will likely discover that your knowledge, understanding, and application skills are far greater than you imagine them to be.
